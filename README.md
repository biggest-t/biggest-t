# Hi i'm  biggest-t

now you may think that that name is a complete ripoff of big T (the most handsome man on the planet) and you'd be completely  right.  but i am infact a bigger than big T *(in  what sense??)* so that makes me undoubtly the biggest T.

anyways, jokes aside i try to have fun with coding.  nothing smart will be found here, i just do stuff because i want to.
  
## As for the software i use
